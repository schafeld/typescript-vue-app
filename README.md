## Getting started with Vue and Typescript

(But... do you really _need_ Typescript for your specific project? Is it likely to become as complex as Google Maps or Docs, go ahead use it. Are you going for a plain shop frontend, think about development and onboarding speed that come as benefits of lower complexity.)
